Let The Deconstruction Begin! This is the official theme for The Deconstruction, a decentralized event that kicks major ass. This site enables participants to create profiles and provide information about their team, then upload blog posts or stream video during the deconstruction event. 

You'll need a full WordPress install to run this nifty site. Activate the Mothership and you are on your way to hosting your very own deconstruction*.

* well, sort of. There's a lot more that goes into it, but hey, this is a good place to start!
